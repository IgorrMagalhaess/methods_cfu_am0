# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I am proud of being able to tackle the exercises without much difficulty. Even though everything is new and can seem daunting, it is very exciting to be able to do all this.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
Methods are a package of intructions and it can be used as many times as needed once defined. The biggest power of methods in ruby is the amount of built in methods that exists and 
you can play around with data in several ways. In case theres no method for what you need, you can define one and use as many times as needed after that.
